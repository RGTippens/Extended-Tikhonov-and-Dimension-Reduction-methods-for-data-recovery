This is the Matlab code for implementing the ‘Extended Tikhonov’ and ‘Dimension Reduction’ methods, documented in the submitted manuscript by Hodjat Pendar, John J. Socha, & Julianne Chung, entitled “New methods for recovering signals in physiological systems with large datasets.” 

The ImpulseResponse.txt and Data.txt files are provided as an example to test the code.
